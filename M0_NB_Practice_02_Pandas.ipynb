Since then, the scope of the pandas project has increased a lot and it has become a popular library of choice for data scientists all over the world.\n","* Pandas allows you to work with both cross-sectional data and time series based data.\n","* The data representation in pandas is done using two primary data structures:\n","  - Series\n","  - Dataframes\n","\n","##### Series\n","\n","* Series in pandas is a one-dimensional ndarray with an axis label.\n","* It means that in functionality, it is almost similar to a simple array.\n","* The values in a series will have an index that needs to be hashable. This requirement is needed when we perform manipulation and summarization on data contained in a series data structure.\n","\n","##### DataFrame\n","\n","* Dataframe is the most important and useful data structure, which is used for almost all kind of data representation and manipulation in pandas. Unlike numpy arrays (in general) a dataframe can contain\n","heterogeneous data.\n","* Pandas dataframes are composed of rows and columns that can have header names, and the columns in pandas dataframes can be different types (e.g. the first column containing integers and the second column containing text strings).
