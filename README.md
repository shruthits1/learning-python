### 1
sort is a mutator, returns none. so if we assign it to a variable , that variable will hold nothing!

### 2
- when defining default extended parameters, as a formatting principle do not give space between parameter name and default value . so that search returns values as well
- You can have multiple default params, when calling the fnction you can mention the parameter and it can be in any order - like for print(a,b, sep=";",end=" ")

### 3
Use pep and ruff to format

### 4
split() without any argument assumes multiple space chars as single delimiter
if you give an argument then it looks for each separator separately
